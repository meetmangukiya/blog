      <description>Hello World! I am kickstarting this website today. I&amp;rsquo;ve been switching themes and platforms. First I tried Jekyll, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t turn out that good for me. Then I started writing a new website from scratch and dropped it in between :P. Now, I am using hugo, seems pretty cool and easy to use until now. Let&amp;rsquo;s hope I stick around this one for a while atleast.
I am using Ghostwriter theme and hope to stick with it.</description>
